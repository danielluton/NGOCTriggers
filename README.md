# NGOCTriggers

Setup Triggers on Contact and Account Objects. 

Test Classes need to be written... To Follow if time allows

Triggers have been tested with standard NGOC/Advancement Connect Features
- Create new Account/Contact through Account Wizard
- Create new Contact Manually
- Create new records through Batch Upload

Triggers ARE NOT supported or guaranteed to work with all systems. Triggers are not intended for use with tools that write data to existing records. ONLY for new Contacts/Accounts

Triggers to allow creation of Account Address and Contact Address on record Inserts when Standard Salesforce address fields are filled in. Targeted at Lead creation but MAY be useful for other apps
